# Smart Energy Management System

## Overview

This project simulates a Smart Energy Management System implemented in Java. The system allows users to input information about energy-consuming devices and estimates the energy consumption level based on the total power consumption of all devices. It provides insights into energy usage and helps optimize energy efficiency.

## Features

- **Device Input:** Allows users to input the names of energy-consuming devices and their respective power consumption values.
- **Energy Consumption Estimation:** Estimates the energy consumption level based on the total power consumption of all devices.
- **Energy Efficiency Optimization:** Provides insights into energy usage and helps optimize energy efficiency.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/smart-energy-management-system.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd smart-energy-management-system
    javac SmartEnergyManagementSystem.java
    java SmartEnergyManagementSystem
    
    ```
    
3. **Enter Device Information:**
    
    Follow the prompts to enter the names of devices and their respective power consumption values.
    

## Usage
